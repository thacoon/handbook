Extending Google Chrome
=======================

Chrome is Google's browser. Here are some useful tips and extensions:

Disabling Instant Search
------------------------

Chrome can search as you type. The advantage of this is that you get search
suggestions and can use Google's predictions - but the disadvantage is that
every character you type is sent to Google's servers, where it may be logged.

To disable, open Chrome's settings by clicking the menu button at the right of
the address bar and clicking Settings. Or, simply type `chrome://settings/` in 
your address bar.

Ensure that the **Enable Instant for faster searching (omnibox input may be
logged)** checkbox is unchecked.

AdBlock for Chrome
------------------

Just like Firefox, AdBlock removes ads. Install from [this Chrome Webstore
page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom).

HTTPS Everywhere
----------------

Forces encrypted https connections wherever possible.  Installation link can be
found on the [EFF HTTPS Everywhere
homepage](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere).

PrivacyFix
----------

PrivacyFix (beta) gives you a dashboard view of your privacy settings on
Facebook and Google, as well as Do-Not-Track headers and tracking cookies. It
provides links to quickly change these privacy settings without digging through
many drilldown pages. Install from the [Chrome web store
page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacyfix-by-privacychoi/pmejhjjecaldkllonlokhkglbdbkdcni)
