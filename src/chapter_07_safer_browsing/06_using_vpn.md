Using VPN?
==========

VPN stands for Virtual Private Network and helps you to reach websites even when direct access is blocked. Furthermore, it helps you to gain online anonymity but also to access a corporate intranet you would not have access to otherwise. A VPN is an encrypted tunnel between two devices.

If Alice wants to views Bob's website, instead of directly talking to Bob like this:

    Alice -> Bob

Using a VPN the connection would look like this:

    Alice -> VPN Server -> Bob

Using this setup Bob does not know that Alice is actually viewing his website. She is making an encrypted tunnel to the VPN server that connects to Bob's website.

The connection to your VPN is encapsulated and encrypted. This way hackers, government or Internet providers cannot see or gain control of the information send between you and the VPN server. The VPN server than makes a regular connection to Bob's website, like your browser would do without using a VPN.

Both, a VPN and a proxy mask your IP address. But a proxy does not encrypt your traffic, this means others can intercept the connection between you and the proxy. This would result in a loss of anonymity. A VPN on the other hand uses an encrypted tunnel that cannot be intercepted by malicious users. A VPN connection is secure as long as there is no major security hole or major misconfiguration in your settings. VPNs should be preferred to proxies.

The benefits of using a VPN compared to other services like Tor is that the data transfer is faster. This allows you to use the internet without any drawbacks. Another benefit is that when you are connected to an untrusted access point like free connections in cafes or hotels you can securly connect to your VPN. Even if the Wi-Fi access point is malicious it then cannot see the websites you are visiting.

But be aware that because you are connecting to the VPN server and authenticate yourself the VPN server knows who you are and which sites you are visiting. So when you do not trust the VPN provider you do not gain any anonymity. Because of this providers that do not log any connections should be used.

Usually universities offer a VPN services so if you are enrolled you probably can use the VPN service of your university for free. Your university website should have much more information about how to use there VPN service.
